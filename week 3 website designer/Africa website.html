<h2><i> Why <i>Africa?</h2>

<h3><i> Tropical beaches that rival some of the world’s best</i></h3>
<p>Africa certainly has a lot of beaches making it impossible to choose the absolute best, though a top pick would be the beaches on the small island of Zanzibar, just off the coast from the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam.
    This small island boasts clear azure waters, coral white sand and plenty of diving and snorkelling opportunities, and is the perfect place to relax after completing a safari or trek up Africa’s highest peaks, Mount Kilimanjaro
     and Mount Kenya.
    Other pristine beaches include Camps Bay, Cape Town’s most popular beach on the edge of a trendy suburb lined with cafe’s and bars and the Skeleton Coast, possibly the world’s most hauntingly beautiful stretch of beach and graveyard for ships across in Namibia.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><i> Vibrant cities<i></h3>
    <p>Africa is a melting pot of the ancient and cosmopolitan cities.

        Explore Morocco’s Marrakesh, a densely packed, medieval city that dates back to the Berber empire. The maze of alleys and thriving markets evokes images of Disney’s Aladdin and you’ll be hard-pressed shaking the image of a magic carpet from your mind as you browse hundreds of intricately hand-woven rugs from the eclectic souks.
        
        In contrast, South Africa’s Cape Town is a modern cosmopolitan city that boasts a spectacular coastline and rich cultural heritage and history. The city is undeniably beautiful both for its setting against one of the new seven wonders of nature, Table Mountain, as well as its regeneration of industrial districts, Dutch, Malay & British influenced architecture, & historic buildings.</p>

<p>In African culture, the “self” is not separate from the world, it is united and intermingled with the natural and social environment.

    It is through relations with one’s community and surroundings that an individual becomes a person of volition, whose actions and decisions affect the entire group rather than just oneself.
    
    There is a Xhosa proverb that is common to all African cultures and languages, “Umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu,” (“A person is a person through persons”).
    
    The rich and diverse African culture varies not only from one country to another, but within each country as well. 
    The culture of each ethnic group centres on family and can be found in each group’s art, music and oral literature.
